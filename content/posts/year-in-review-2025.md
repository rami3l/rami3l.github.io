At this very moment, a multitude of different emotions are swirling in my mind,
to the point that I decided to at least try to grasp some of them for the
record, despite the fact that this might be very rare for me to do so in such
an occasion.

In 2024, I plunged myself into waiting for a job-seeking permit that never
came. Looking back, I had very much enjoyed that wait during which I was super
active and enthusiastic online as if I were an OSS maintainer for which I had
some sort of a full-time obligation, except that burning myself without real
professional prospects was, despite how good it might seem, not leading me
anywhere.

After accepting that strategic failure, this year started with a necessary
compromise of settling in a `$DAYJOB`. I didn't plan anything in particular in
advance, quite the contrary to my _modus operandi_, since this new chapter was
fully out of my vision until I set foot in the new workplace.

As it turned out, what could be better to me back then than being thrown into
unknown waters and forced to swim? I was lucky enough to be surrounded by super
supportive comrades and friends and, thanks to their kindness, I was able to
open new doors and to explore possibilities never imagined before. Trips along
the southeastern Chinese coast and the crazy week in the Netherlands were
definitely among my personal highlights, but so are the various projects,
public or private, that I have started or helped reshape in the year. Moreover,
the stars must have aligned for me, giving birth to the absolute personal
miracle that has sent me half the globe away to where I am now.

All things considered, 2025 has been a very remarkable point in my trajectory,
and it seems that the secret ingredient of my extraordinary experiences in this
year was really proving to myself that I am alive through the ceaseless
pursuit, or, in other words, the _dance_.

I was reminded that a few weeks back, while announcing the rustup 1.29.0 beta
CfT, I was surprised by a kind [remark][cft-remark] pointing out that I didn't
even remember to give myself the kudos I had always deserved. I am, on the
other hand, constantly thinking when writing this post that maybe this will
finally be the right place to deliver to myself that grant of appreciation:

Many thanks to myself for having _danced_ it through this year, as well as to
my dear friends who are reading this post for your valueless support and
encouragement along the way. I wish 2026 will be an even more exciting year for
everyone :)
