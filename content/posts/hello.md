Hi there!

I have been using GitHub repos as my scratchpads since my very first days as a self-taught developer.

However, it did occur to me recently that I could use some more organized form of output.

Hopefully, this blog will help me take notes of my random ideas and efforts
while providing the right contexts for them,
so that they might not remain undiscovered lying in my repos.

Ã€ trÃ¨s bientÃ´t! ðŸ‘‹
