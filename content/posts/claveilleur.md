## Problem

Being a polyglot can be painful sometimes.

Particularly, it is extremely common for me to have multiple windows open at the
same time, each using a different language: at this very moment, I have my
messenger on where I participate conversations in Chinese, and I am writing this
post in English at the same time in my VSCode window.

As a result, with OS defaults, I have to switch between input sources (a.k.a.
input methods) so often that I have even grown the bad habit of continuously
pressing the `fn` key for... nothing at all. Assuredly, `fn` is more convenient
than Windows PCs' `win + space`, but wouldn't it be much better if I don't have
to press any key?

You might ask: doesn't `System Settings` have that feature built right in? Well,
kind of. The problem here is that this feature of automatically switching input
source is based on the current **document**, and thus macOS can get it wrong
quite frequently.

Wouldn't it be much better if macOS could switch input sources on a **per-app**
basis, just like Windows does? [^1] In fact, there are already many non-free
solutions out there that prove this point, like
[`Input Source Pro`](https://inputsource.pro) and
[`KeyboardHolder`](https://keyboardholder.leavesc.com/zh-cn).

Now that it is theoretically possible, why not make my own "lite version" just
for fun?

Whence comes [`Claveilleur`](https://github.com/rami3l/Claveilleur), my own
open-source macOS input source switching daemon, whose name comes from the
French words for keyboard (clavier) and watchman (veilleur).

## Workflow

Just one caveat before we actually begin: I'm not your regular Apple developer.

On the one hand, I do appreciate the speed of ARM-based Macs and the abundance
of well-made GUI apps on macOS, but as a random dev mostly doing cross-platform
app development, I haven't used Xcode that much, and I'm just a bit reluctant to
leave my polyglot-friendly VSCode...

On the other hand, the lure of Swift does seem irresistible this time (despite
the fact that I'm still new to Swift and more at ease with Rust): it has nearly
seamless Objective-C interoperability support and I have heard of it even having
some exclusive high-level macOS API bindings.

Fortunately, Apple also provides
[`SourceKit-LSP`](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) that allows me to code
in Swift using any LSP-compatible editor. Combined with the
[`SwiftPM`](https://www.swift.org/package-manager) CLI to build the project in
the terminal, this does seem to provide the level of VSCode support that I would
expect from a popular programming language. Thus, `Claveilleur` was made
entirely without launching Xcode. [^2]

## Solution

I want `Claveilleur` to be a CLI app in the style of
[`skhd`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) and
[`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai). All you need to do as a regular
user is to download the all-in-one binary, use its CLI to tell `launchd` that
you have a new daemon, and then you're good to go!

### Detecting Input Source Changes

It should be clear by now that the core of `Claveilleur` relies on observing
certain macOS desktop events such as the change of the current input source and
of the frontmost app.

Let's first try to detect current input source change. The problem is, what APIs
should I use to achieve that?

It did take me quite some time to find the right search engine keywords,
navigate to this very
[`StackOverflow answer`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26697027), and have some
slightest clue about what this Objective-C snippet is doing:

```objc
[[NSDistributedNotificationCenter defaultCenter]
           addObserver:self
              selector:@selector(myMethod:)
                  name:(__bridge NSString*)
                           kTISNotifySelectedKeyboardInputSourceChanged
                object:nil
    suspensionBehavior:NSNotificationSuspensionBehaviorDeliverImmediately];
```

I haven't written a single line of Objective-C, but it does look like C extended
with
[Smalltalk-style messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Messages)...

Aha! So here we are calling the `addObserver` method of the default
`NSDistributedNotificationCenter` with `myMethod` as the callback function.

Let's see how this might translate to Swift (\*typing in VSCode\*)...

```swift
DistributedNotificationCenter.default.
```

Wait. This looks interesting...

```swift
func publisher(
  for name: Notification.Name,
  object: AnyObject? = nil
) -> NotificationCenter.Publisher
```

It turns out that
[`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter/publisher)
allows the use of FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) on
[`NotificationCenter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/notificationcenter)s!

From here, things should become much easier...

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/Observers.swift#L9-L25" >}}

The code is as readable as it gets if you are familiar with FRP:

- `.publisher()`: We are processing the stream of input source change events.
  Whenever this happens, a `kTISNotifySelectedKeyboardInputSourceChanged`
  message will be posted in `DistributedNotificationCenter.default`.
- `.map()`: Whenever a message arrives, we immediately get the current (new)
  input method.
- `.removeDuplicates()`: We also need to ensure that the user is indeed
  switching to a different input method.
- `.sink()`: We get the current (frontmost) app, and associate it with the
  current input method. Later, when the current app changes, we can then use
  this information to restore the input method to that associated value.

Yes, it's just **that** simple... Or is it?

### Detecting Current App Changes

The previous snippet assumes that `getCurrentAppBundleID` is correctly
implemented, but how on earth should we get the current app and detect its
change?

`NSWorkspace.shared` has a `frontmostApplication` field, the changes of which
are even observable. Thus, it is very tempting to get the app bundle ID directly
from there:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/AppUtils.swift#L35-L38" >}}

... except it doesn't work all the time.

The corner case is encountered when, for example, the user activates Spotlight
with `cmd + space`: the `frontmostApplication` simply doesn't change at all!

According to
[this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/36264038), this is
because floating windows (such as those of Spotlight and Alfred) are somewhat
special:

> [They] aren't really active because they use the `NSNonactivatingPanelMask`
> style mask, but they still can be focused.

... but there has to be another way, right?

Yes! Right in that question thread,
[Ryan H](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2246381/ryan-h) has proposed what could
very likely be the way forward:

> [...] get pids for all the apps you want, and use `AXObserver` and
> `AXObserverAddNotification` to get notifications on them.

The `AX` prefix here seems to stand for
[Carbon Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/carbon_accessibility).
This makes perfect sense, since the aforementioned proprietary apps also need
accessibility privileges to run in the first place!

At this point, the plan for the next step is quite clear: I need to detect every
single `kAXFocusedWindowChangedNotification` or
`kAXApplicationHiddenNotification` message in order to correctly find out the
current app! Sounds tedious, isn't it?

To make things worse, using `AXObserver*` APIs for this purpose has some main
difficulties:

- Those APIs are old C-style ones, which require another kind of dance to call,
  completely different from what we have seen previously.
- Those APIs are called on a per-PID basis, but I am not sure what PIDs will be
  useful to me.
- The business logic of getting the current app is since disconnected from the
  way of detecting current app changes.

#### Receiving `kAX*` Messages for a Single PID

Now, let's implement the detection and handling of `kAX*` messages in the
`WindowChangeObserver` class.

Sadly, we can not write this part of the code directly in the FRP style: the
[Carbon Accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/carbon_accessibility)
APIs, which belong to Apple's C-based Carbon framework, seem to date from as
early as Mac OS X v10.2, but most Carbon APIs have already been deprecated since
v10.8, so Apple obviously didn't take the time to provide high-level
abstractions for them.

However, I did find just the right amount of info in
[this Chinese blog post](https://juejin.cn/post/6919716600543182855) to make my
`WindowChangeObserver` work. As it turns out, the way of calling `AXObserver*`
APIs looks quite like the Objective-C snippet in the
[Detecting Input Source Changes](#detecting-input-source-changes) section, but
this time, I'm writing all of this in Swift rather than in C.

The first thing to do is to declare `WindowChangeObserver` as a subclass of
`NSObject`:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/WindowChangeObserver.swift#L4-L15" >}}

The `notifNames` mapping here not only gives the two types of messages that we
care about, but also helps convert `kAX*` messages to regular
`Notification.Name`, so that we can send them to a `NotificationCenter` and
handle them in the "old" way.

Next, we declare the callback for the observer:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/WindowChangeObserver.swift#L17-L33" >}}

We need to remember that Carbon is a C-based framework, so naturally we are
declaring a C-compatible callback above. That is to say, despite being written
as a Swift closure, we are not allowed to capture any variable from the
environment in the callback, and the `self` reference is hidden in the `refcon`
parameter.

However, apart from this restriction, what the callback does is still quite
clear: it simply sends the converted `Notification.Name` to
`localNotificationCenter`.

The implementation of `init` and `deinit` methods is quite boring, since they do
almost nothing other than initializing and deinitializing `rawObserver`
respectively:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/WindowChangeObserver.swift#L35-L69" >}}

... where `.unwrap()` is just a convenience method to convert `AXError`s to
exceptions and throw them.

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/AXError%2BExtensions.swift#L3-L13" >}}

#### Tracking the Interesting PIDs

This time, let's maintain a collection of `WindowChangeObserver`s for each
useful PID in the `RunningAppsObserver` class.

As usual, `RunningAppsObserver` should be declared as a subclass of `NSObject`:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/RunningAppsObserver.swift#L3-L11" >}}

Here, `rawObserver` will be initialized to an Objective-C key-value observation
of `currentWorkSpace.runningApplications`, which is responsible for maintaining
the `windowChangeObservers` collection by repeatedly calculating the latest
changes in the observed collection of running apps:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/RunningAppsObserver.swift#L13-L45" >}}

Finally, thanks to the directions of
[this Python snippet](https://gist.github.com/ljos/3040846), we can use
[Quartz Window Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/quartz_window_services)
[^3] to obtain the collection of "interesting" PIDs ("interesting" as in "having
a GUI"):

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/RunningAppsObserver.swift#L47-L63" >}}

To this point, we have finally obtained an observer that can detect current
window changes from an automatically-adjusted range of PIDs and send
`Claveilleur.focusedWindowChangedNotification` or
`Claveilleur.appHiddenNotification` messages to `localNotificationCenter`
accordingly:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/Observers.swift#L63" >}}

#### Consuming the Messages

After all the above efforts, we can finally return to the familiar FRP-style
APIs.

First, we have a bunch of different bundle ID-generating publishers, all likely
to indicate a new current app:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/Observers.swift#L27-L41" >}}

Then, all we need to do is to declare another observer that consumes all those
publishers, and saves or loads input sources according to the current app:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/Observers.swift#L43-L61" >}}

#### Getting the Current App

Now, the core functionality of `Claveilleur` is complete. With so much time
being spent detecting current app **changes**, the only missing piece in the
puzzle [^4] seems to be the way of actually getting the current app.

Long story short: I haven't completely figured that part out. I have found
different ways of doing this, but it seems to me that every single one of them
might fail in one way or another under certain circumstances.

At the time of writing, this is achieved by
[combining `AXUIElementGetPid` results and `NSWorkspace` ones](https://github.com/rami3l/Claveilleur/blob/fb591deca97463a4f20e60d6cface75881c82c35/Sources/AppUtils.swift),
which seems to yield the correct result for over 90% of the time.

### Correctly Getting Accessibility Privileges

When configuring the CI builds for `Claveilleur`, a natural idea is to build a
Universal 2 (a.k.a. "fat") binary that supports both x64 and ARM64
architectures:

```sh
swift build -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64
```

However, when running this build on ARM-based Macs, it seemed that the
Accessibility Privileges can never be granted
([Claveilleur/#2](https://github.com/rami3l/Claveilleur/issues/2)).

That is, the following function always returns `false`:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Sources/Privilege.swift#L5-L8" >}}

As it turns out, this has something to do with the code signing rules that macOS
is enforcing. It just so happens that when the app is not a macOS bundle,
[it could be very hard get it signed correctly](https://www.smileykeith.com/2021/10/05/codesign-m1).

I solved this problem by first creating a minimal bundle manifest under
`Supporting/Info.plist`:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Supporting/Info.plist" >}}

... then embedding the manifest into the executable [^5] by adding
`linkerSettings` to the `.executableTarget()` section in `Package.swift` like
so:

{{< emgithub owner=rami3l repo=Claveilleur branch="0a5e8d2" file="Package.swift#L40-L46" >}}

... and just to be sure, signing the CI build again before publishing:

```bash
codesign -dvvv --force --sign - \
  "$(swift build --show-bin-path -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64)/claveilleur"
```

## Conclusion

This is in fact only my second time doing Swift (after
[`Ouverture`](https://github.com/rami3l/Ouverture)), and my feelings towards
this overall experience are still quite complicated at this moment.

On the one hand, Swift does seem like a beautifully-designed programming
language to me, which, just like Rust, cares a lot about bringing modern
features and patterns into a traditional procedural/object-oriented context.

On the other hand, it seems to me that even as a somewhat experienced developer,
having to use quite a bunch of under-documented and under-maintained APIs is
still a major issue while getting my hands on macOS desktop development.

I wish Apple could realize this issue and... change things for the better in the
future, maybe?

    However, turning on this feature on Windows will lead to another issue where
    the task bar is also considered as an app. My friend
    [`Icecovery`](https://github.com/Icecovery)'s
    [`IMEIndicator`](https://github.com/Icecovery/IMEIndicator) provides more
    details on it and a (hacky) workaround.

    that is.
