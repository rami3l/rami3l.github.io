## Why?

Being a polyglot can be painful sometimes.

Particularly, it is extremely common for me to have multiple windows open at the same time, each using a different language:
at this very moment, I have my messenger on where I participate conversations in Chinese,
and I am writing this post in English at the same time in my VSCode window.
As a result, with OS defaults, I have to switch the input source (a.k.a. the input method) very, very often.

In fact, I have to press the `fn` key so many times a day on my Mac to ensure the input source is in the right state
that I have even grown the bad habit of continuously pressing it for nothing at all.
Assuredly, `fn` is more convenient than Windows PCs' `win + space`, but what if I don't have to press any key?
