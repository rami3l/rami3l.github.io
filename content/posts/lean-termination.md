> You are filled with de*termination*...

[Doing proofs](https://github.com/rami3l/plfl) from
the book [_Programming Language Foundations in Agda_](https://plfa.github.io)
in the Lean 4 prover has really been a refreshing experience for me.
However, things did get annoying sometimes for me,
especially when I just couldn't get pass the termination check.

Although I haven't seen every piece of the puzzle yet,
I do hope that by sharing what I have seen so far,
this blog post could save you some time from bashing "lean termination" into your search box,
which could potentially lead you to some random web pages about
[Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) ðŸ˜…

## The Factorial

### Proof by Structural Recursion

Let's start with an old classic, the factorial function:

{{< include file="code/posts/lean-termination/LeanTermination/Basic.lean" language="lean" from=1 to=1 >}}
{{< include file="code/posts/lean-termination/LeanTermination/Basic.lean" language="lean" from=5 to=7 >}}

We can add some "unit tests" to ensure that this is indeed the `fact` that we all know and love:

{{< include file="code/posts/lean-termination/LeanTermination/Basic.lean" language="lean" from=9 to=9 >}}

In trivial cases (like this one),
it's quite possible that the termination proof is already done for you.

The following might be an intuitive way of seeing how this proof is possible:

1. `fact` has only one argument (let's call it `n : â„•`),
   so in order to prove that `fact` terminates,
   we need to prove that `n` decreases.

2. We search the function body for all call sites of `fact`,
   and it turns out there's only one `fact n` which is required by `fact (n + 1)`.

3. `âˆ€ n : â„•`, `n` is smaller than `n + 1`, so `n` is indeed decreasing.

... wait a minute.
Did I say _decreasing_?
What is actually decreasing here?

According to the [docs](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/induction_and_recursion.html#structural-recursion-and-induction),
we are using a _structural recursion_ here,
and thus it's `n`'s _structure_ that is decreasing.
After all, `â„•` is inductively defined:

{{< emgithub owner=leanprover repo=lean4 branch="a62d2fd" file="src/Init/Prelude.lean#L1038-L1044" >}}

So you can see the decrease in `n`'s structure as a decrease in
the number of constructors (`.zero`/`.succ`) required to construct `n`.

### Proof by WF Recursion and `termination_by`

What if the structural recursion doesn't work,
and we have to use a [well-founded (WF) recursion] [^wf-rec] instead?

[well-founded (WF) recursion]: https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/induction_and_recursion.html#well-founded-recursion-and-induction

[^wf-rec]:
    The notion of WF recursion won't be explained in detail here.
    The key intuition in this notion, however,
    is that for a function `f (v : Î±) : Î²` to be total, it suffices that
    every `v` should be mapped to a body in `Î²` that...

    <!-- markdownlint-disable-line -->

    - Either has nothing to do with `f`;
    - Or depends on some `f w` where `w : Î±`,
      and there exists a
      [WF relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation)
      `â‰º` ("smaller") that ensures `w â‰º v`,
      so that the "routing table" _won't_:
      - Form a loop (e.g. `f a := f b; f b := f a`);
      - Or forward all the way down without ever falling back to any base case
        (e.g. `f (a : â„¤) := f (a - 1)`).

Again, looking at the [docs](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/induction_and_recursion.html#well-founded-recursion-and-induction),
it seems that this is as easy as adding a `termination_by` clause:

{{< include file="code/posts/lean-termination/LeanTermination/Basic.lean" language="lean" from=11 to=14 >}}

The compiler will then try to find an implicit instance `wf : WellFounded â„•`,
(Spoiler: there is more than one!)
and try to conclude that `n` is decreasing in terms of `wf.rel`.

Let's say it has found `Nat.lt_wfRel : WellFounded â„•`,
which stands for the well-foundedness of `Nat.lt` (i.e. the `<` operator on `â„•`):

{{< emgithub owner=leanprover repo=lean4 branch="a62d2fd" file="src/Init/WF.lean#L151-L153" >}}

Since `n < n + 1` trivially holds, the termination proof is again completed.

### Proof by WF Recursion and `decreasing_by`

In fact, it is according not to us, but to the compiler that `n < n + 1` "trivially holds".
When a `termination_by` clause is not followed by a `decreasing_by` clause,
a default one will be generated right beside it:

```lean
decreasing_by decreasing_tactic
```

... where `decreasing_tactic` is defined as follows:

{{< emgithub owner=leanprover repo=lean4 branch="a62d2fd" file="src/Init/WFTactics.lean#L52-L53" >}}

... and the triviality of `n < n + 1` (and many other similar arithmetic statements)
is already included in `decreasing_trivial`:

{{< emgithub owner=leanprover repo=lean4 branch="a62d2fd" file="src/Init/WFTactics.lean#L22-L28" >}}

What if we want to write a `decreasing_by` clause by ourselves?

<!-- {{< emgithub owner=leanprover repo=lean4 branch="a62d2fd" file="src/Init/WFTactics.lean#L33-L44" >}} -->
<!-- {{< emgithub owner=leanprover repo=lean4 branch="a62d2fd" file="src/Init/WFTactics.lean#L12-L13" >}} -->
