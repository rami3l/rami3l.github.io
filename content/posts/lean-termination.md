[Doing proofs](https://github.com/rami3l/plfl) from
the book [_Programming Language Foundations in Agda_](https://plfa.github.io)
in the Lean 4 prover has really been a refreshing experience for me.
However, things did get annoying sometimes for me,
especially when I just couldn't get pass the termination check.
